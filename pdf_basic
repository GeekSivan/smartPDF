7 Syntax
This clause covers everthing about the syntax of PDF at the objects, file, and document level.
PDF syntax contains 4 parts:
1) Objects: A PDF document is a data structure composed from a small set of basic types of data objects.
2) File Structure. The PDF file structure determines how objects are stored in a PDF file, how they are accessed, and how they are updated. It is independent of semantics of the objects.
3) Document structure: The PDF Document Structure specifies how the basic objects types are used to represent components of a PDF document: pages, fonts, annotations, and so forth.
4) Content Streams. A PDF content stream contains a sequence of instructions describing the appearance of a page or other graphical entity.
--------------------------------------------------
Character Set
The PDF character set is divided into three classes, called re gular,  delimiter , and  white-space characters.

PDF includes eight basic types of objects: Boolean values, Integer and Real numbers, Strings, Names, Arrays, Dictionaries, Streams, and the null object.
