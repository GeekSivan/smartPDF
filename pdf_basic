PDF Basic  From Document management  — Portable document format — Part 1: PDF 1.7 (use tool node++ to view file bytes).
--------------------------------------------------
7 Syntax
This clause covers everthing about the syntax of PDF at the objects, file, and document level.
PDF syntax contains 4 parts:
1) Objects: A PDF document is a data structure composed from a small set of basic types of data objects.
2) File Structure. The PDF file structure determines how objects are stored in a PDF file, how they are accessed, and how they are updated. It is independent of semantics of the objects.
3) Document structure: The PDF Document Structure specifies how the basic objects types are used to represent components of a PDF document: pages, fonts, annotations, and so forth.
4) Content Streams. A PDF content stream contains a sequence of instructions describing the appearance of a page or other graphical entity.
--------------------------------------------------
Character Set
   The PDF character set is divided into three classes, called re gular,  delimiter , and  white-space characters.  
--------------------------------------------------
Objects
   PDF includes eight basic types of objects: Boolean values, Integer and Real numbers, Strings, Names, Arrays, Dictionaries, Streams, and the null object.
--------------------------------------------------
Steam Filters
   An option when reading stream data is to decode it using a filter to produce the original non-encoded data. Whether to do so and which decoding filter or filters to use may be specified in the stream dictionary.
PDF supports a standard set of filters  that fall into two main categories: ASCII filters   and Decompression filters.
ASCIIHexDecode/ASCII85Decode/LZWDecode/FlateDecode/RunLengthDecode/CCITTFaxDecode/JBIG2Decode/DCTDecode/JPXDecode/Crypt
Every Decode Filter has exactly decode asthmatics.
--------------------------------------------------
File Structure
 A basic conforming PDF file shall be constructed of following four elements:
 *  Header: A one-line header identifying the version of the PDF specification to which the file conforms.
 *  Body: A body containing the objects that make up the document contained in the file.
 *  CR Table: A cross-reference table containing information about the indirect objects in the file.
 * Trailer: A trailer giving the location of the cross-reference table and certain special objects within the body of file.
