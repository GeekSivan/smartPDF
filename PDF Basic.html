Aim: To create a smart, smooht, glimme, greedy pdf reader for people on Android Platform.

About 3 year ago, I bought a HTC MobilePhone which used Android platform, at that time I want to develop a smart pdf for me to read some books. At that time pdf reader such as Doc2go..., You cant it to open pdf but you can not read pdf in a small size screen. the character is too tiny to read and at text mode, all the text layout is not good as html/wps.
From today, i reclaim this dream and do it in 2 months plan.
